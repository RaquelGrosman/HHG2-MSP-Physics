Tensors:
“A tensor is a mathematical object which transforms as a tensor”
uhh umm okay? Let us break it down!
Tensor comes from the latin word “to stretch”. Tensile stress can be described as the feeling of stretching something out. This is what tensors can measure, the quantity sides/different dimensions change (stretch) when one of them is changed. A tensor has this neat ability to remain a tensor and have the same physics occur when is it transformed – when one changes its coordinate system. The math and values might change but the physics of it will not! 
-------- okay but how is this measured and calculated? 
First, perhaps a different definition:
A rank – n tensor in m – dimensions is a mathematical object that has: n indices and m¬¬n components and obeys “certain transformation rules”.  
--------- hmm still a bit abstract…
The dimensions, m is the dimension (lol). M is simply the dimension of the matrix.

What is “rank”?
For rank, n signifies the parameters that are necessary to find what you are looking for within the mathematical object. It is the numerical amount of information needed to find selection (component) within a matrix.  
Example: For a matrix which is RxR and neither R is 1, the parameter needed to find components within matrix are simply Row and Column (look at along row and down column) therefore there are 2 parameters (“rank 2”)  n=2. N is the quantity of indices, here there would be two. 
If the matrix was Rx1, then n=1, because we would only need to look from one direction. While if the matrix changed to an IxJxK (a 3-d matrix) then there would be 3 parameters, n=3, three directions to search needed to find desired component. 
For example, the electromagnetic tensor is a rank n=2 and a dimension m=4 tensor (4x4). (insert picture)
---As we progress, and understands tensors better, we begin to use index notation. 
When the tensor symbol (usually a Greek letter) does not have an index it means it is rank 0, which means one doesn’t need any information to find a component – there is only one value attached to tensor….. it is a scalar!
Rank 
n=0, scalar. 
n=1, one piece of info, one index, necessary to find component, vector. Example velocity of a rolling ball on surface.
n=2, two pieces of information, two indices
Traditionally for 2- and 3-dimensions Latin letters are used. 4 dimensions and higher Greek letters are used. 
n=3, three indices
n=4, four indices 
and so on. 
----------- a bit better??
Well now more on the physics of a tensor! 
A tensor can describe an object to which can be “moved” (stretched or compressed) along the 3 spacial directions. BUT, then also each side of the object can also undergo structural strain (6 more stresses) – therefore it can be said there are 9 possible stresses.  
Forces can not just be added along the 3-d because they are interacting differently. Each of the 9 forces makes the object “react in a different way”. 
Therefor a way to express this is with a 3x3 matrix (matrix just a mathematical tool which can help in some scenarios organize numbers more understandable/workable). When a tensor has a 3x3 matrix it means its dimension is 3  m = 3. 
What makes them tensors? HOW THEY TRANSFORM (COORDINATE SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION).
-chosen coordinate system should and does not affect the physics of the situation. Physical nature remains the same, although the components “amounts” might change.
(angular momentum is actually a psudo vector, because if the origin changes, the time can go to zero, therefore changing the actual physics not just the maths of this vector) [magnetic field is also a psudovector]
Velocity is a real vector. If a vector is zero in one coordinate system, for it to be a real vector, it should be zero in all coordinate systems.   
Velocity can be relative, the ball moves relative to the table but not relative to itself. 
Boost is a 4-d coordinate rotation. Velocity, is a 4- velocity : n= 1, m=4 Tensor.  
Rank 2 tensor can not be visualized like an vector, arrow, but it can be though of as a transformation between vectors.  
Ex: 
F=q(v x B+E)
 (insert matrix)
The cross product with the  4-velocity will change the velocity of a charged particle into a force. 

It is a number or a collection of numbers which maintains its MEANING under coordinate transformations. The components of tensor will change, but the physical nature will not (after coordinate transformation).






GR and RE uses 4d tensors bcz of time!


Vector, direction and magnitude

A matrix is a linear transformation…
